# 4-0. Introduction

We use loops to do things repetitively  
There are two kinds of repetitive structures in Python
- For loop
- While loop

# 4-1. Simple For Loop

**Syntax:**
```python
# Using range function
for [loop_variable] in range([start], [stop], [step]):
  [statement 1]
  [statement 2]

# Iterating over a file
for [line] in [file_pointer]:
  [action to do with each line]

# Many more ...
```

## a. Range Function

The in-built range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers  

```python
for num in range(5):
  print(num)
```
<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ”Ž Closer look:
  </summary>
  In the above statement, range(5) generates a sequence of five numbers starting with zero, that is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4<br>
  The variable num is called a loop variable<br>
  When the for loop starts, the num variable stores the value 0<br>
  The print(num) displays 0<br>
  The control goes back to the for loop and this time num stores the value 1<br>
  The print statement displays it<br>
  This keeps happening until there are no more numbers left in the sequence<br>
  Hence the output is<br><br>
  0<br>
  1<br>
  2<br>
  3<br>
  4<br>
</details>

### Let's slow it down:

```python
from time import sleep # Don't worry about this statement
for num in range(5):
  print(num)
  sleep(5) # Don't worry about this statement
```

### Example, let's say a runner has to run around a track, say, 5 times. How does he keep track of what lap number he is in? How do we write for loop in Python for that?

```python
for lap in range(5):
  print(lap)
```

Well in real life, lap numbers start at 1 not at 0. So, how do we change the range function?

```python
for lap in range(1, 6):
  print(lap)
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ”Ž Closer look:
  </summary>
  In the range function, 1 is start and 6 is end.<br>
  Loop runs until the variable lap is equal to end-1<br>
  So the sequence generated is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
</details>

### Other variations of the range function:

```python
# Using start, stop and step
for num in range(2, 17, 3):
  print(num)
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ”Ž Closer look:
  </summary>
  In the range function, 2 is start, 17 is end and 3 is step<br>
  So the sequence generated is 2, 5, 8, 11, 14<br>
  Loop runs until the variable num is equal to end-1, that is why 17 is not displayed
</details>

```python
# Using start, stop and negative step
for num in range(25, 2, -4):
  print(num)
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ”Ž Closer look:
  </summary>
  When using negative step, the sequence is generated in descending order<br>
  In the range function, 25 is start, 2 is end and -4 is step<br>
  So the sequence generated is 25, 21, 17, 13, 9, 5<br>
  Loop runs until the variable num is equal to end-1<br>
  Start must be greater than end when using negative step

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ’¡ Note:
  </summary>
  We don't necessarily have to use the loop variable    
</details>

Let's modify our example, say the runner has to run around a track, say, 10 times. Each time he finishes a lap, he must eat a banana and we print `Eat a banana`

```python
for lap in range(10):
  print("Eat a banana")

# Notice, we didn't use the loop variable anywhere inside our loop
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ‘‰ Try this 4-1a:
  </summary>
  Ask a user to enter a whole number. Write a for loop so a runner has to run around a track, the user specified number of times. Each time he finishes a lap, he must eat a banana, and we print Eat a banana.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ‘€ Answer 4-1a:
  </summary>
  
  ```python
  num = int(input("Enter number of laps: ")) # convert user value to int
  for lap in range(num):
    print("Eat a banana")
  ```
</details>

## b. Accumulator variable

Well, lets change our scenario, how about the runner eats a banana only for the even laps that he runs. How do we print the number of bananas he ate?

```python
num_of_bananas = 0 # We assign 0 to a variable BEFORE the for loop
for lap in range(1, 11):
  if lap%2 == 0:  # Check if remainder is zero when divided by 2
    num_of_bananas += 1   # We add 1 to the variable only when it is even lap
print(num_of_bananas)

# num_of_bananas is called an accumulator variable
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ‘‰ Try this 4-1b:
  </summary>
  A runner runs each lap and eats the lap number of bananas. That is, first lap, he eats one banana, second lap, he eats two bananas, so on. How many bananas does he eat after running 5 laps?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ‘€ Answer 4-1b:
  </summary>

  ```python
num_of_bananas = 0
for lap in range(1, 6):
    num_of_bananas += lap
  
print(num_of_bananas)
  ```
</details>


# 4-3. Nested for loops

When a for loop is inside another for loop, it is called nested for loop  

Let's change the previous scenario, where the runner has to run the red track 5 times and each time he runs the red track, he has to run the blue track 3 times. Each time he runs the red track, he has to eat a banana and each time he runs the blue track he eats a strawberry. How many bananas and how many strawberries does he eat? How to write Python for loops for this?

```python
for red_lap in range(1, 6):
  print("Eat a banana")
  for blue_lap in range(1, 4):
    print("Eat a strawberry")

print(f'{red_lap} bananas')
print(f'{red_lap * blue_lap} strawberries')
```

- New scenario 1:
  - The runner has to run the red track 5 times
  - Each time he runs the red track,
    - he eats a banana
    - he has to run the blue track 3 times - each lap around blue track he eats a strawberry
    - he finishes running blue track and then goes to green track
    - he has to run the green track 2 times - each lap around green track he eats a blueberry
  - How many bananas, strawberries and blueberries does he eat? How to write Python for loops for this?

- New scenario 2:
  - The runner has to run the red track 5 times
  - Each time he runs the red track,
    - he eats a banana
    - he has to run the blue track 3 times - each lap around blue track he eats a strawberry
    - each time he runs the blue track he has to run the green track 2 times - each lap around green track he eats a blueberry
  - How many bananas, strawberries and blueberries does he eat? How to write Python for loops for this?

# 4-4. While loop
A while loop is a repetitive structure that is used when the number of times the loop needs to run is determined at run-time  
For example, in our runner example, instead of giving the runner a specific number of laps to run, what if, the runner is asked to run laps until the user says "stop" and eat a banana for each lap?

## Syntax:
```python
[initial_condition]  
while [check_condition]:  
  [perform_actions]  
  [change_conditon]
```

  While loop has 3 important components to work<br>
  Otherwise, the program will run indefinitely
</details>

```python
action = "run" # initial condition
while action != "stop": # checking the condition so it evaluates to True
  print("Eat a banana")
  action = input("Continue? (run/stop): ")
```
