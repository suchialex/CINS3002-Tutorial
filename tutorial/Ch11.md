# Intro to Inheritance
- Inheritance allows a new class to extend an existing class. the new class inherits the members of the class it extends
- This is like a parent and child relationship.
- The child class (also called subclass or derived class) inherits all the properties of the parent class (superclass or base class) and can also have its own properties


## Why inheritance?
- When one object is a specialized version of another object, there is an "is a " relationship betweeen them.
- Through inheritance we can "clone" an existing class and all its attributes and methods and then add our own attrbiutes and methods

## For example:
![Image](../.tutorial/images/inheritance.jpg)

- A college student has attributes name, major, classification and GPA
- If this student were to take the class CINS 3002, then in addition to name, major, classification, gpa he/she will have attributes to store the scores specific to this class, i.e.
  - video quiz
  - homework
  - exam
- So it makes no sense to create a class for CINS3002 student and repeat the attributes that are already stored by Student class
- Instead, a sub class or child of Student can be created which
  - "inherits" name, major, classification and gpa AND
  - can also define its own attributes (or methods)
- Similarly with CINS 3006, which has its own set of attributes

  Through inheritance we can "clone" an existing class and all its attributes and methods and then add our own attrbiutes and methods<br>
The class we clone is called the parent (or super class) and the new class created is called a child (or sub class)

## Different types of inheritance
1. Single Inheritance - (parent-child)

![Image](images/single-inheritance.png)

2. Mutliple Inheritance - (parent-parent-child)

3. Multi-Level Inheritance - (parent-child-grandchild)

### Without inheritance

Let's look at two classes
  
```python
class Student():
  def __init__(self):
    print("This is Student init")

class CINS_Student(): 
  pass
```
- Let us create an object of Student
- init gets called and the print statement is executed
  
```python
student1 = Student()
```

Now let us create an object of CINS_Student

```python
cins = CINS_Student()
```

This class doesn't have an init method, so nothing is displayed

# 11-1. Single Inheritance

## a. Creating a child for an existing parent
In Python, a child is created by using parent class' name in parantheses

![Image](images/single-inheritance.png)
```python
class Student():
  def __init__(self):
    print("This is Student init")

class CINS_Student(Student): 
  pass

# CINS_Student is the child of Student
# Student is the Parent of CINS_Student
```

Let us create an object of Student (which is the parent)

```python
student1 = Student()
```

- Obviously, the parent's init gets called and the print statement is executed
- Now let us create an object of the child, which is CINS_Student

```python
# This class doesn't have an init method, so nothing must be displayed, BUT ... WAIT!!

cins = CINS_Student()
```
 
<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ¤“ Inference: 
  </summary>
  Because, there is a parent-child relationship, the child "inherited" the parent's init method!
</details>

# 2. Single Inheritance With Class Attributes

## Can we try with some attributes?
Create class attributes inside parent class

```python
class Student():
  college = "ULM" # I am a public class attribute
  _dept = "CINS" # I am a protected class attribute

class CINS_Student(Student): 
  pass
```

Let's access these attributes outside the class

```python
# Let's see parent behavior
student1 = Student()
print(student1.college)
print(student1._dept)
```

```python
# Let's see child behavior
cins_student1 = CINS_Student()
cins_student1.college
print(cins_student1._dept)
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ‘‰ Inference: 
  </summary>
  The child inherited the parent's class attributes
</details>

# 3. Single Inheritance With Methods

## Let's add methods in parent class

Define the methods inside the class
```python
class Student():
  # public method
  def parent1(self):
    print("Parent1")

  # protected method
  def _parent2(self):
    print("Parent2")

class CINS_Student(Student): 
  pass
```

Call them outside the class
```python
# parent behavior
student1 = Student()
student1.parent1()
student1._parent2()
```

```python
# child behavior
cins_student = CINS_Student()
cins_student.parent1()
cins_student._parent2()
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ¤“ Inference: 
  </summary>
  The child also inherited the parent's public and protected methods
</details>


# 4. Method Overriding (aka Polymorphism)

- Polymorphism allows subclasses to have methods with the same names as the methods in their superclasses.
- It gives the ability for a program to call the correct method depending on the type of object that is used to call it.

## 4a. Method overriding with init
Let's add an init to the child class definition

```python
class Student():
  def __init__(self):
    print("This is student init")

class CINS_Student(Student):
  pass
  # def __init__(self):
  #   print("This is CINS student init")

```

Call them outside the class
```python
student1 = Student()
cins_student = CINS_Student()

# Now uncomment the child's init and see what happens
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ¤“ Inference: 
  </summary>
  When child has its own init, the parent's init is overridden and child uses its own init
</details>


## 4b. Let's add a method with same name to both parent and child

```python
class Student():
  def method1(self):
    print("This is student method1")

class CINS_Student(Student):
  def method1(self):
    print("This is CINS student method1")

student1 = Student()
student1.method1()

cins_student = CINS_Student()
cins_student.method1()

```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ¤“ Inference: 
  </summary>
  When child has a method with the same name of that of the parent, the parent's method is overridden
</details>


# 11-5. Child Accessing Parent's Methods Instead of Overriding

## What if child wants to access both its methods and the parent's methods too?
- We use a special method called super()
- super() can be used only INSIDE the child class

```python
class Student():
  def method1(self):
    print("This is student method1")

class CINS_Student(Student):
  def method1(self):
    super().method1()
    print("This is CINS student method1")

cins_student = CINS_Student()
cins_student.method1()
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ’¡ Note: 
  </summary>
  Instead of super, we can use the parent class name to call its methods inside the child class<br>
  But, we have to pass self as the first argument

  ```python
  class Student():
    def method1(self):
      print("This is student method1")

  class CINS_Student(Student):
    def method1(self):
      Student.method1(self) # accessing using parent's name
      print("This is CINS student method1")

  cins_student = CINS_Student()
  cins_student.method1()

  ```
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ‘‰ 11-5: Try This:
  </summary>
  
  In the above example
  - Write an init in the parent class and print `Hello`
  - From the child class' init method, call the parent init
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ‘€ Answer:
  </summary>

  ```python
class Student():
  def __init__(self):
    print("Hello")

class CINS_Student(Student):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__() # accessing the parent's init
    
cins_student = CINS_Student()
```
</details>

# 11-6. Parent's Access To Child's Methods (or attributes)


```python
class Student():
  def method1(self):
    print("This is student method1")

class CINS_Student(Student):
  def method2(self):
    print("This is CINS student method1")

cins = CINS_Student()
cins.method1()
cins.method2()

# Now uncomment these lines and see

# student = Student()
# student.method1()
# student.method2()

```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ¤“ Inference:
  </summary>
  In inheritance, child can access parent's attributes and methods but a parent cannot access a child's methods or attributes
</details>


# 7. Multi-Level Inheritance

![Image](images/multi-level-inhertiance.png)

- Grandchild class can access its own attributes, and both child and parent class' attributes and methods
- Child class can access its own and its parent's attributes and methods
- Parent class can access only its attributes and methods

## Creating multi-level inheritance

```python
class Parent():
  def __init__(self):
    print('Parent Init')

class Child(Parent):
  pass

class Grandchild(Child):
  pass
```

Now let's create objects and see how they behave

```python
p = Parent()
# c = Child()
# g = Grandchild()
```


# 11-8. Multiple Inheritance

![Image](images/multiple_inheritance.png)

For the scope of this class, we will not be going into this type of inheritance
